Installing the 12 Factor App
****************************

This project uses CMake. Configure the project my changing
directory to new directory to be used as your build directory.
Run `cmake <dir' where <dir> is the path to src. You may then
run your make commands from the build directory.

Run `make' to build the project.

Run `make install' to install to your system directories (e.g.
/usr/local, et al.). Use DESTDIR=<path> to change the root of the
installation. For example `make DESTDIR=$HOME install' will use
$HOME as the root directory instead of /.

Run `make clean` to clean the project.
